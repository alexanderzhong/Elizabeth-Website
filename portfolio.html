              I built "Ajenda" as a personal project of mine both initially as a
              small commercial product and as a way to get familiar with Android
              Studio and the android libraries/android app workflow. I decided to
              not to make it commerical because of marketability and
              revenue-model, but I still think it is a worthwhile idea with the
              right execution. "Ajenda" is a productivity app that optimizes
              scheduling by automatically placing events based on a variety of
              different factors, including weather and driving time. The idea is
              that the user can say something like "Schedule Workout Sessions for
              5 times a week", and the app should be able to place workout events
              in your schedule in the best possible times. Currently, the app has
              full calendar functionality along with persistent data storage for
              events. Although the calendar seems to be the regular calendar UI
              component, it is actually a custom made UI component, and it can and
              will be changed in the future. The app also currently uses
              OpenWeatherMap API and Google Maps API to obtain weather and
              distance information. <br />

              I built the app "Scotty Security" with some of my friends during
              TartanHacks (hackathon at CMU). We built it as a cross-platform app,
              using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create the front end, and a
              website that allowed for simple server processing to build the
              backend. The idea came from one of the themes given in the
              hackathon, which was campus security. We figured that while there
              several security apps/websites that helped people stay safe, there
              wasn't one that had everything that a student would need. So, we
              came up with "Scotty Security", which is a all in one campus
              security app, with access to nearly all of the security resources at
              CMU, including CMU police department and a map of campus. The
              features of the app include location tracking, news notifications,
              an emergency whistle, audio recording, and a contacts list/page. We
              used Cordova and Node.js to build the app (in our presentation, we
              built it for android). We also used Google Maps API for location
              tracking, and we built a simple set of RESTful APIs to transfer
              location information. I built most of the front end, and the simpler
              functions of the app that didn't require backend usage, including
              the emergency whistle and the audio recording functionality. Since
              two of the people on my team were not familiar with front end
              development, I also taught and guided them through building some of
              the front end with HTML, CSS, and JS. I'm really proud of this
              project, not only because I contributed a lot to it and that we were
              able to make a successful final product in the 24 hours we were
              given, but also because I think that the team worked really well
              together and I'm proud of what we created as a group. <br />
              By the way, I have included a video of a quick demonstration of our
              project. It's a bit rough, but it was nearly the deadline, and we
              needed to submit soon.

              I did a research project on the pancreatic protein CD39L3 during my
              junior year of highschool and the following summer (2017). I worked
              with Professor Simon Robson and his lab at Beth Israel Deaconess
              Medical Center, and they mentored and advised over the course of my
              project. To provide some background knowledge on CD39L3, it is a
              glycoprotein found in the pancreas that is involved with Purinergic
              Signaling. Specifically, it is an enzyme that catalyzes purine
              nucleotides such ATP and GTP, and plays a role in regulating their
              signaling function. CD39L3 is a glycoprotein, which means it
              contains carbohydrate structures attached to its polypeptide chain.
              My project focused mainly on these structures, and I created several
              glycoforms of the protein, where I removed various amounts of sugar
              from the protein. I then measured the activity of these forms,
              included a model for the protein structure, and analyzed the
              potential impacts of these new glycoforms. This is a very watered
              down explanation of the proejct, but more information can found in
              my research paper, which was published in the peer-reviewed journal
              "Purinergic Signaling" and will be linked below. I also submitted
              this to the Regeneron Science Talent Search and was a National
              Semifinalist.
