					I built "Ajenda" as a personal project of mine both initially as a small commercial product and as a way to get familiar
					with Android Studio and the android libraries/android app workflow. I decided to not to make it commerical because of
					marketability and revenue-model, but I still think it is a worthwhile idea with the right execution. "Ajenda" is a 
					productivity app that optimizes scheduling by automatically placing events based on a variety of different factors, 
					including weather and driving time. The idea is that the user can say something like "Schedule Workout Sessions for
					5 times a week", and the app should be able to place workout events in your schedule in the best possible times. 
					Currently, the app has full calendar functionality along with persistent data storage for events. Although the calendar
					seems to be the regular calendar UI component, it is actually a custom made UI component, and it can and will be 
					changed in the future. The app also currently uses OpenWeatherMap API and Google Maps API to obtain weather and 
					distance information. <br/> <br/>
					Future Features: More optimal scheduling algorithm, Completed Speech Recognition

					I built the app "Scotty Security" with some of my friends during TartanHacks (hackathon at CMU). We built it as a
					cross-platform app, using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create the front end, and a website that allowed for simple
					server processing to build the backend. The idea came from one of the themes given in the hackathon, which was campus
					security. We figured that while there several security apps/websites that helped people stay safe, there wasn't one
					that had everything that a student would need. So, we came up with "Scotty Security", which is a all in one campus
					security app, with access to nearly all of the security resources at CMU, including CMU police department and a map 
					of campus. The features of the app include location tracking, news notifications, an emergency whistle, audio 
					recording, and a contacts list/page. We used Cordova and Node.js to build the app (in our presentation, we built it 
					for android). We also used Google Maps API for location tracking, and we built a simple set of RESTful APIs to transfer 
					location information. I built most of the front end, and the simpler functions of the app 
					that didn't require backend usage, including the emergency whistle and the audio recording functionality. Since two of 
					the people on my team were not familiar with front end development, I also taught and guided them through 
					building some of the front end with HTML, CSS, and JS. I'm really proud of this project, not only because I contributed 
					a lot to it and that we were able to make a successful final product in the 24 hours we were given, but also because I 
					think that the team worked really well together and I'm proud of what we created as a group. <br/>
					By the way, I have included a video of a quick demonstration of our project. It's a bit rough, but it was nearly
					the deadline, and we needed to submit soon.

					I did a research project on the pancreatic protein CD39L3 during my junior year of highschool and the following summer 
					(2017). I worked with Professor Simon Robson and his lab at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and they mentored and 
					advised over the course of my project. To provide some background knowledge on CD39L3, it is a glycoprotein found in the 
					pancreas that is involved with Purinergic Signaling. Specifically, it is an enzyme that catalyzes purine nucleotides such
					ATP and GTP, and plays a role in regulating their signaling function. CD39L3 is a glycoprotein, which means it contains 
					carbohydrate structures attached to its polypeptide chain. My project focused mainly on these structures, and I created 
					several glycoforms of the protein, where I removed various amounts of sugar from the protein. I then measured the activity
					of these forms, included a model for the protein structure, and analyzed the potential impacts of these new glycoforms. 
					This is a very watered down explanation of the proejct, but more information can found in my research paper, which was 
					published in the peer-reviewed journal "Purinergic Signaling" and will be linked below. I also submitted this to the 
					Regeneron Science Talent Search and was a National Semifinalist.
